# Research-Oriented Technical Memos

This repository contains technical memos documenting research-oriented system design and empirical analysis conducted through real-world deployments in institutional and academic settings.

The memos focus on:
- Problem formulation under practical constraints
- Data characteristics and limitations
- Methodological choices and alternatives
- Evaluation strategies in the absence of labeled data
- Open research questions and directions

These documents are intended to provide additional context for my prior work at the intersection of machine learning, systems, and data-driven decision-making.

## Contents

1. Anomaly Detection in E-Procurement Pricing Systems  
2. Similarity-Based Allocation of Academic Supervisors  
3. Multimodal Demand Modeling for Academic Library Resources  
4. Research Performance Analytics Platform  

Each memo is self-contained and written to emphasize reasoning, assumptions, and empirical findings rather than software implementation details.

## Notes

The systems described in these memos served as research instruments, enabling analysis of real-world challenges such as data sparsity, non-stationarity, and policy constraints. Where applicable, limitations and potential research extensions are explicitly discussed.
