# Research-Oriented Technical Memos

This repository contains technical memos documenting research-oriented system design and empirical analysis conducted through real-world deployments in institutional and academic settings.

The memos focus on:
- Problem formulation under practical constraints
- Data characteristics and limitations
- Methodological choices and alternatives
- Evaluation strategies in the absence of labeled data
- Open research questions and directions

These documents are intended to provide additional context for my prior work at the intersection of machine learning, systems, and data-driven decision-making.

## Contents

1. Anomaly Detection in E-Procurement Pricing Systems  
2. Similarity-Based Allocation of Academic Supervisors  
3. Multimodal Demand Modeling for Academic Library Resources  
4. Research Performance Analytics Platform  

Each memo is self-contained and written to emphasize reasoning, assumptions, and empirical findings rather than software implementation details.

## Notes

The systems described in these memos served as research instruments, enabling analysis of real-world challenges such as data sparsity, non-stationarity, and policy constraints. Where applicable, limitations and potential research extensions are explicitly discussed.

## *Status note*  
These documents describe exploratory research derived from real-world systems and are shared to provide context on problem formulation, methodology, and evaluation under practical constraints. The work has not yet been submitted for peer review and continues to evolve.
