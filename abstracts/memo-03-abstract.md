## Memo 1 — Robust Anomaly Detection in E-Procurement Pricing Systems

Procurement pricing data is characterized by sparsity, heterogeneity, and temporal non-stationarity, limiting the effectiveness of static rules and supervised anomaly detection approaches. This memo examines a semi-supervised, robust framework for identifying anomalous procurement prices under these conditions. Category-conditioned baselines are estimated using robust statistics and adapted over time to account for distributional shift. Empirical analysis on institutional procurement data indicates that non-robust estimators and fixed thresholds generate excessive false positives in sparse and volatile categories, while robust adaptive baselines improve stability and operational usability. The memo concludes by outlining limitations and research directions for governance-oriented anomaly detection systems.
