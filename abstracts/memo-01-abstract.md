## Memo 3 — Multimodal Demand Modeling for Academic Library Resources

Demand modeling for academic library resources is commonly based on circulation data alone, overlooking behavioral signals generated through digital access platforms and physical infrastructure. This memo investigates whether heterogeneous access signals can be integrated to produce more stable and informative estimates of latent demand. Using multimodal institutional data comprising physical access logs, online access records, and circulation histories, simple regression and time-series baselines are evaluated under unimodal and multimodal settings. The analysis suggests that multimodal models yield more robust demand estimates than circulation-only approaches, particularly during atypical academic periods. The memo concludes by discussing limitations and directions for institutional demand modeling under real-world constraints.
